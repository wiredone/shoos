Day 17 Review - a Shoo Shoppe

Shoos

A new small business, shoos, have completed the design of their first shoe product. Whilst they setup the manufacturing process and await stock they have approached you to setup a pre-order web app.

They want an app that will:

Take name, address, quantity and size (the only sizes available are 7,8,9,10,11)
Display a confirmation page with the details they entered
Each entry should be persisted to a database and all pre-orders displayed on a seperate page
